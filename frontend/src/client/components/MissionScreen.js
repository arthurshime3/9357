            Maintaining a proper diet is difficult. For patients of Grady Memorial Hospital,
            this difficulty is compounded with the need for medical care, and frequently with
            a lack of socioeconomic resources. Some medical conditions can greatly affect the
            dietary needs and restrictions of patients, making creating a satisfactory diet
            even more challenging.

            The Food as Medicine Initiative aims to meet the needs of low-income patients by
            recommending affordable and accessible meals based on their dietary needs. We have
            seen firsthand the impact of spending more time with loved ones, instead of needing
            to return to a hospital because of complications. We hope to make this a much less
            common occurrence. Meal kit products are frequently too expensive for many patients,
            or do not take into account the variety of constraints placed on their diets. Our
            project will cater to as many patients as possible, while being freely usable. Patients
            will be able to understand how they can diversify their diet, and know what ingredients
            they will need to prepare their meals. We hope you will join us as we make food the
            best medicine!
